The Abstract.

Paper: ArXiv link

Our implementation is based on [N2V](https://github.com/juglab/n2v).

## Installation
This implementation requires [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/).
We have tested Noise2Void on LinuxMint 18.3 using python 3.6 and tensorflow-gpu 1.12.0.
Once tensorflow in installed, you can clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/juglab/StarVoid.git
```
Change into its directory and install it:
```
cd StarVoid/noise2seg
pip install -e .
```
You are now ready to run noise2seg of StarVoid.
